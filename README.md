# Debugging Faults in Software Product Lines with Rule Induction Algorithms

Material of the experiments reported in the following paper submitted to the 
24TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE CONFERENCE (SPLC 2020):

*Jos√© Galindo, Ruben Heradio, David Fernandez-Amoros, and David Benavides*. 
**Debugging Faults in Software Product Lines with Rule Induction Algorithms.** 

## JHipster

[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) is a code generator for web applications 
with 45 selectable features that can produce a total of 26,256 valid configurations.

In:

*Axel Halin, Alexandre Nuttinck, Mathieu Acher, Xavier Devroey, Gilles Perrouin, Benoit Baudry*.
**Test them all, is it worth it? Assessing configuration sampling on the JHipster Web development 
stack**. *Empirical Software Engineering 24(2): 674-717 (2019).*

an exhaustive strategy is adopted to test the JHipster system, checking all its valid configurations.
The test cases, together with their resulting status are [here](https://github.com/xdevroey/jhipster-dataset).
