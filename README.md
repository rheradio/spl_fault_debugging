Material of the experiments reported in the following paper submitted to the 
24TH ACM INTERNATIONAL SYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT LINE CONFERENCE (SPLC 2020):

**Debugging Faults in Software Product Lines with Rule Induction Algorithms.** 

## JHipster

[JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech/) is a code generator for web applications 
with 45 selectable features that can produce a total of 26,256 valid configurations.

In:

*Axel Halin, Alexandre Nuttinck, Mathieu Acher, Xavier Devroey, Gilles Perrouin, Benoit Baudry*.
**Test them all, is it worth it? Assessing configuration sampling on the JHipster Web development 
stack**. *Empirical Software Engineering 24(2): 674-717 (2019).*

an exhaustive strategy is adopted to test the JHipster system, checking all its valid configurations.
The test cases, together with their resulting status, are [here](https://github.com/xdevroey/jhipster-dataset).

We have applied three  classical rule induction algorithms to explain the detected faults. 

Our experimental data is organized in the following directories:
* [original_data](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/tree/master/jhipster/original_data) includes the CSV file with all tests gathered from [Halin et al.'s repository](https://github.com/xdevroey/jhipster-dataset).
* [script_code](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/tree/master/jhipster/script_code) includes two scripts written in the R language:
  + [induce_rules.r](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/blob/master/jhipster/script_code/induce_rules.r) processes the CSV in  [original_data](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/tree/master/jhipster/original_data) and generates the explaining rules using three alternative algorithms: LEM2, CN2, and AQ. 
  + [crossvalidation.r](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/blob/master/jhipster/script_code/crossvalidation.R) performs a 10-Fold cross-validation of the algorithms LEM2, CN2, and AQ. Also, the script generates a box-plot that summarizes the results.
  + [plot_rule_statistics](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/blob/master/jhipster/script_code/plot_rule_statistics.R) generates the following plots to summarize the synthesized rules: (i) A histogram and a box-plot analyzing feature interactions, (ii) a cumulative plot relating the rules' coverage achieved with the interactions factor, and (iii) a histogram showing rules' coverage.
* [induced_rules](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/tree/master/jhipster/induced_rules) includes the generated rules.
* [rule_statistics](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/tree/master/jhipster/rule_statistics) includes the statistics generated with [crossvalidation.r](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/blob/master/jhipster/script_code/crossvalidation.R) and [plot_rule_statistics](https://github.com/rheradio/spl_fault_debugging/blob/master/jhipster/script_code/plot_rule_statistics.R) .
